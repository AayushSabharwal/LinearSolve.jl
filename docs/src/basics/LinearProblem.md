# Linear Problems

## Mathematical Specification of a Nonlinear Problem

### Concrete LinearProblem

To define a `LinearProblem`, you simply need to give the `AbstractMatrix` ``A``
and an `AbstractVector` ``b`` which defines the linear system:

```math
A*u = b
```

### Matrix-Free LinearProblem

For matrix-free versions, the specification of the problem is given by an
operator `A(u,p,t)` which computes `A*u`, or in-place as `A(du,u,p,t)`. These
are specified via the `AbstractSciMLOperator` interface. For more details, see
the [SciMLBase Documentation](https://scimlbase.sciml.ai/dev/).

Note that matrix-free versions of LinearProblem definitions are not compatible
with all solvers. To check a solver for compatibility, use the function xxxxx.

## Problem Type

### Constructors

Optionally, an initial guess ``uâ‚€`` can be supplied which is used for iterative
methods.

```julia
LinearProblem{isinplace}(A,x,p=NullParameters();u0=nothing,kwargs...)
LinearProblem(f::AbstractDiffEqOperator,u0,p=NullParameters();u0=nothing,kwargs...)
```

`isinplace` optionally sets whether the function is in-place or not, i.e. whether
the solvers are allowed to mutate. By default this is true for `AbstractMatrix`,
and for `AbstractSciMLOperator`s it matches the choice of the operator definition.

Parameters are optional, and if not given, then a `NullParameters()` singleton
will be used, which will throw nice errors if you try to index non-existent
parameters. Any extra keyword arguments are passed on to the solvers.

### Fields

* `A`: The representation of the linear operator.
* `b`: The right-hand side of the linear system.
* `p`: The parameters for the problem. Defaults to `NullParameters`. Currently unused.
* `u0`: The initial condition used by iterative solvers.
* `kwargs`: The keyword arguments passed on to the solvers.
